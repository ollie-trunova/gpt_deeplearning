Skateboarding is an action sport originating in the United States that involves riding and performing 
tricks using a skateboard, as well as a recreational activity, an art form, an entertainment industry 
job, and a method of transportation. Skateboarding has been shaped and influenced by many skateboarders 
throughout the years. A 2009 report found that the skateboarding market is worth an estimated 
$4.8 billion in annual revenue, with 11.08 million active skateboarders in the world. In 2016, it was 
announced that skateboarding would be represented at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, for both male 
and female teams.

Since the 1970s, skateparks have been constructed specifically for use by skateboarders, 
freestyle BMXers, aggressive skaters, and more recently, scooters. However, skateboarding has become 
controversial in areas in which the activity, although illegal, has damaged curbs, stoneworks, steps, 
benches, plazas, and parks.
