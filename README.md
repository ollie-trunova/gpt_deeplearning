Getting familiar with chat gpt 3.5 through code
All the info is from the course learn.deeplearning.ai/chatgpt-prompt-eng , the examples are from my head.

Each step is covering 1 topic: 
Step 1 - basic prompts
Step 2 - turning text into a ready html format
Step 3 - using for loops for big amounts of similar data
Step 4 - proofreading a text and visually comparing the new version with the previous one
