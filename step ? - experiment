Toucans are indeed restricted to tropical realms and occur from tropical forests in Mexico south 
to northern Argentina. Although they are absent from Caribbean Islands, several toucan species range 
in cloud forest, rainforest, and tropical savannah habitats. Costa Rica is fortunate to have 6 species 
of toucans and even better, most are fairly easy to see!

In general, toucans are very social birds that occur in pairs or small flocks. They nest in tree cavities 
and use their large beaks to eat fruit, insects and many other small creatures, including eggs and nestlings 
of other birds. They act somewhat like jays and crows, often call from high perches, and are often found at 
fruiting trees. Toucans also visit fruit feeders!
